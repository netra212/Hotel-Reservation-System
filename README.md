# üè® Hotel Reservation System

A machine learning-based project designed to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not. This solution helps hotels optimize **revenue**, **target marketing efforts**, and **detect fraudulent behavior** ‚Äî improving decision-making and profitability.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

To build a predictive model that classifies whether a customer will **cancel** a hotel booking based on their reservation details.

---

## üéØ Target Audience

The primary audience is **hotels** and **hospitality businesses** aiming to improve booking reliability, increase revenue, and reduce operational disruptions due to cancellations.

---

## üíº Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Revenue Management
Allows smart overbooking by predicting cancellations in advance.  
**Example**: If the system predicts *Arun* will cancel his booking for Room A509, the hotel can allow *Rahul* to book the same room ‚Äî minimizing revenue loss.

### 2. Targeted Marketing
Enables hotels to provide **personalized offers** (e.g., free dinner, spa access) to customers who are likely to cancel, increasing retention.

### 3. Fraud Detection
Detects and flags users with a pattern of frequent cancellations, helping hotels reduce fraudulent or disruptive behavior.
